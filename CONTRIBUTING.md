### Coding Guideline

This section is intended to describe the coding conventions applied for the Step. Please refer to it when contributing code to the repository.

Our single guide currently is to apply [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html), which has a great number of tips on writing clear and idiomatic Go.
